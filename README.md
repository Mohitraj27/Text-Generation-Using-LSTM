# Text-Generation-Using-LSTM

## About the Project
The poem by Robert Frost "Stopping by words on the Snowing Evening" was converted from PDF to text, pre-processed, and tokenized using word indexes. It was transformed into 50-word sequences. An LSTM model with a vocabulary size and vector space of 50 was trained for 200 epochs, achieving 84.83 accuracy.

### Automatic Text Generation
Automatic text generation is the generation of natural language texts by computer. It has applications in automatic documentation systems, automatic letter writing, automatic report generation, etc. In this project, we are going to generate words given a set of input words. We are going to train the LSTM model using Robert Frost poem Stopping by woods in a snowing evenining which is taken in pdf format and then converted into text file.

Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening Robert Frost  
 
 Whose woods these are I think I know  
His house is in the village though  
He will not see me stopping here  
To watch his woods fill up with snow  
 
My little horse must think it queer  
To stop without a farmhouse near  
Between the woods and frozen lake  
The darkest evening of the year  
 
He gives his harness bells a shake  
To ask if there is some mistake  
The only other sounds the sweep  
Of easy wind and downy flake  
 
The woods are lovely dark and deep  
But I have promises to keep  
And miles to go before I sleep  
And miles to go before I sleep  
  Admiring Light on a Sunny Day Erika Fitzpatrick  
 
What light this is I may it know  
Its beams barred by finite time though  
He should not mind me pausing now  
To admire this light ere it go  
 
My wearied mind considers how  
There is time enough to allow  
Dead and dilated eyes to gaze  
On light thats not for me endowed  
 
It filters through in timid haze  
For this room its not seen in days  
Dust dances where lighted  day glows  
In mute music and golden rays  
 
Sunlight is happy hope arose  
But I have ssignments to close  
And pages to rove before I doze  
And pages to rove before I doze
